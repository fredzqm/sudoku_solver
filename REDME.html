<h4>Objectives</h4>

The purpose of this assignment is to gain first hand experience that
one can write software that is better than the person who develops it;
with fairly little effort.

<h4>Assignment</h4>

<ul>
<li>Implement and test a backtracking algorithm to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku problems</a>.

</li><li>Implement the the MRV, degree, and Least constraining value heuristics.

</li><li>Extra credit for any additional improvements you may make. Please
have a look at our book for ideas. We only scratched the surface. 

</li><li>Work on the implementation of this assignment by yourself.

</li><li>You may assume a 9x9 grid.

</li><li>Your software needs to read input as follows. A 9x9 grid of
numbers, corresponding to the 9x9 layout of a typical Sudoku game. The
number zero (0) represents an empty space. Below is an example.

<pre>360020089
000361000
000000000
803000602
400603007
607000108
000000000
000418000
970030014
</pre>

</li><li>Your software should output a solution if it exists, or a comment
stating that no solution exists.

</li><li>Feel free to experiment with larger grids.

</li><li>Here is some <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse413/assignments/csp/SudokuProblems.zip">test data</a>.

</li><li>Provide a brief write-up (less than a page) documenting your experience with this
assignment. How well did the backtracking only code do on the
assignments? How did the variable and value assignment methods
improve the results? Was there a performance difference between the
easy, medium and hard problems? Document any extra credit improvements
you may have attempted.

</li><li>The grading server is not set-up for this assignment.

</li><li>Please submit your code to the appropriate drop-box on Moodle.
